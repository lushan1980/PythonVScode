You can use the following code to generate a requirements.txt file:
pip install pipreqs

pipreqs /path/to/project


Sometimes you come across pip freeze, but this saves all packages in the environment including those that you don't use in your current project.

pip freeze > requirements.txt

how to check requirements.txt file:
cat requirements.txt
